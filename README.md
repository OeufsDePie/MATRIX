MATRIX : MVG (Multiple View Geometry) Assistant Tool for Reconstruction from Images eXtraction.

## What is MATRIX ?

MATRIX is a project developed by students in the context of a last-year 7-week school group project.
This project aims at developing a tool to ease the task of collecting a dataset of pictures of a
scene for 3D reconstruction. The project is casted in the context of the European Project
[POPART](http://www.popartproject.eu/),
in which the team [VORTEX](http://www.irit.fr/-Equipe-VORTEX-)
and [Mikros Image](http://www.mikrosimage.eu/) are involved.
POPART aims at developing tools for the real­time pre­visualization of special effects
during the shooting of a movie.
In such context, the preliminary task is to collect a dataset of images of the scene
where the movie will take place and perform an accurate 3D reconstruction of the scene,
that will later be used for real­time camera localization purpose.
