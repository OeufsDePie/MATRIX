Camera connection
*****************

To connect a camera, simply plug in your camera and the application will detect it automatically. If it does, you will see a green *Connected* on the screen and the name of
your camera (if gphoto is able to detect it). 

Once your camera is connected, and once you have a functionnal workspace with the default scene or another scene, you can import pictures from it. To do so, simply follow this instruction :

- Click on *Scene* then *Import Pictures* then *From camera ...*

Note that this will import every pictures on your camera as thumbnails. This can take quiet a long time, even thumbnails are usually lightweight.

Once the import is done, you can choose which thumbnail to not import as real picture by setting there state to *Discarded*. Once your selection is done,
simple click on *Tools* and then *Confirm thumbnails*
