Managing workspaces and scenes
=============================

Workspaces
----------

Here we will explain how to manage workspaces. They are working the same way than eclipse workspaces. In our software, you can create, delete, save or change workspace.

- To create a workspace : in the menu bar, click on *Workspace* then *New workspace*, or use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+N*
- To save your current workspace under a specific location : click on *Workspace* then *Save Workspace*, or use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+s*
- To open an already existing workspace : click on *Workspace* then *Open Workspace* 
- To close the current workspace : click on *Workspace* then *Close Workspace*
- To change the current workspace to an already existing workspace : click on *Workspace* then *Change Workspace*

Scenes
------

To use scenes, you must be working in a specific workspace. Once the workspace is created, the application automatically creates a *default* scene. You can do the usual operation with scenes :

- To create a scene : click on *Scene* then *New scene* or use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+n*
- To delete the current scene : click on *Scene* then *Delete scene* or use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+d*
- To change the current scene : click on *Scene* then *Change scene*

In a scene, you can import pictures. You can either import them from a directory, or from a camera. We will be talking about how to import pictures from a camera in another part. 


Current limitations and possible improvements
---------------------------------------------
Our actual implementation of the workspace is quiet functionnal but there are still a few problems with workspace that we unfortunatelly notice too late : 

- If you have multiple workspace and try to switch workspace, you will still have pictures from your last workspace.
